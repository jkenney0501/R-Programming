# R-Programming
Just a bIt of practice with R. This is a demonstration of the various tools in R and to be used as a reference. More to be added in the future as it is accumulated. At some point it will be converted into Jupyter notebooks for easier reference to the concepts. My goal to is to make a really good and simple reference for some common scenarios we use in data science.
